# Philly Neighborhood Food Access Exploration
An Analysis on Food Access in Philadelphia

## Overview
This project will explore whether there are any relationships between food access in Philadelphia and socioeconomic factors such as poverty level and vehicle availability. The dataset used in this evaluation comes from OpenDataPhilly.org (link below).

## Background 

The data was collected for each unique Census Block Group within Philadelphia. Each Block Group represents a certain number of residents within a geographic location.  

The main attributes on which I focused my analysis are listed below:

* Total Number of Low Produce Supply Stores
* Total Number of High Produce Supply Stores
* Percent High Produce Supply Stores
* Supermarket Access (Y/N): based on 0.5 mile radius
* Percent Poverty: percent of residents that fall below the Federal Poverty Line at the time of collection
* Percent Vehicle Availability

### Definitions:  
* **High Produce Supply Store (HPSS)**: Stores that carry a certain amount of fresh fruits and vegetables   
   * *Ex: typical supermarkets*
* **Low Produce Supply stores (LPSS)**: stores that carry little to no fresh fruits or vegetables.  
  * *Ex: gas stations and corner stores* 
* **Percent HPSS**:  HPSS / (HPSS + LPSS)

## Questions to Explore
#TODO: should I delete questions I didn't end up exploring? 
1. Is there a difference in poverty level between areas that have access to a supermarket and areas that do not have access to a supermarket? 

1. Is there a difference in vehicle availability between areas that have access to supermarkets and those that do not?

1. Is there a difference in the percentage of high produce supply stores based on poverty classification? 


1. Is there a difference in the number of low produce supply stores based on poverty classification?

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Initial Exploration: 

The raw dataset had 1336 entries and 17 columns.

**Null Values:**
There were 13 null values within the raw dataset, 11 of which corresponded to the non-residential areas within Philadelphia. These null values were excluded, as I was interested in the areas with residents. 

**Initial Visualizations**

I intially spent a lot of time visualizing the data through scatterplot matrices, overlaid histograms, and cumulative distributions.

The data for total number of low produce supply stores by poverty classification was interesting, as it indicated that high poverty areas could be more likely to have more low produce supply stores (i.e. stores that do not sell fruits and vegetables).

***Modeling Exploration: Total LPSS***

I thought that total LPSS might follow a Poisson distribution, where the unit of space was the Census Block Group and each "event" was the presence of an LPSS. 

Maximum Likelihood Approach: 
* Poisson model to converge on the variable lambda, approximated by the sample means

    ```
    * Mean(High Poverty Areas) = 33.86
    * Mean(Not High Poverty Areas) = 24.4
    ```

The figure below clearly shows that the data were not generated by a Poisson distribution.

*So what might be going on?*

It's likely that our Block Groups are not independent and identically distributed with respect to LPSS; it's more likely that each subsection of Philadlephia has specific demands for the food retail scene. It is interesting that the three areas with the highest number of low produce supply stores are those which likely draw the most non-residents (students and commuters).

### ***Analysis: Supermarket Access and Vehicle Availability***

![Vehicle Availability and Supermarket Access](images/pdfandcdf_pct_vehicle_by_supermarket.jpeg)

**Further Exploration: Is there a difference in the mean vehicle access between areas with supermarket access and areas without supermarket access?**

Methodology: comparison of means

* Relied on boostrapping because distributions were not normal
* For each bootstrap sample, I plotted the difference in means (supermarket - no supermarket)
* Calculated the 95% confidents interval for the difference in means (see dashed lines at the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles)


***Conclusion**: Vehicle availability is **higher** in areas **without supermarket access**.  The difference in mean vehicle availability is between 2.51% and 7.85%, based on a confidence level of 95%*

### ***Analysis: Poverty Levels and Food Access***

The dataset was split into two categories: High Poverty and Not High Poverty.  High Poverty areas are those in which greater than 20% of residents fell below the Federal Poverty Line.

**Further Exploration: Is there a difference in HPSS percentage in High Poverty areas vs. Not High Poverty areas?**

Methodology: comparison of medians

* Compared medians instead of means due to presence of several outliers (right-skewed)
* Relied on boostrapping because distributions were not normal
* For each bootstrap sample, I plotted the difference in medians (high poverty - not high poverty)
* Calculated the 95% confidence interval for the difference in medians (see dashed lines at the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles)

*Conclusion: Areas with poverty levels above 20% have a lower percentage of HPSS stores than areas with poverty levels above 20% (with 95% confidence)*

# Supporting Information / Appendix
## Hypothesis Testing

1. Is there a difference in vehicle access between areas with supermarket access and those without supermarket access? 

    Null Hypothesis: H<sub>0

    >The mean vehicle availability for areas with supermarket access is the same as the mean vehicle availability for areas without supermarket access.


    Alternative Hypothesis: H<sub>A

    >The mean vehicle availability in areas WITH supermarket access is different than the mean vehicle availability in areas WITHOUT supermarket access.

    Significance Level (alpha) = 0.05
